# Drop Weight Impact Testing Rig

This project is an STM32-based control system for a drop weight impact testing rig. It is designed to conduct controlled impact tests on composite materials by dropping a predefined mass from a calculated height based on the desired force. The system records data during the impact and provides options to export the results.
